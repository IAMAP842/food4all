Submission Idea for Hack4Bengal Hackathon 3.0


Our submission to the Hack4Bengal Hackathon 2024 addresses the pressing issue of food wastage in restaurants and hotels. Often, surplus food items such as vegetables, fruits, and other edibles are discarded, leading to significant waste. Our project proposes a solution in the form of a web application where restaurants and hotels can list their excess food items. NGOs can then connect with these establishments to collect and distribute the surplus food to the poor and needy. This initiative aims to improve food waste management and help those in need.


# **Frontend:-**
The frontend folder contains a React-based frontend application built with Vite.

# **Setup:-**
Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd food-frontend

# **Install dependencies:**
npm install

# **Development:-**

This will start the frontend application in development mode.

But before starting the frontend the backend should be started

# **Backend:-**
The backend folder contains a simple Express.js backend with mongodb.

# **Setup:-**
Navigate to the backend directory:
cd backend

# **Install dependencies:**
npm install
Add your own mongodb uri

# **Starting the Backend:-**
